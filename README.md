> In this program, A folder is locked or unlocked via Face Recognition.

> The access is granted only if it confirms that it is my face.

> There are diffrent conditions to ensute that image of person is not used.

> Program runs for about 3 seconds, and for my hardware the parameters I set work perfectly.

> Hence due to limited time, unlocking through Image becomes almost impossible.

> If program cannot decide, we are prompted to enter password.

> Hashed password is saved in the program so finding out real passsword becomes impossible.

> Password is protected via my encryption technique and that encrypted cyphertext is hashed.
